REAL TIME WEATHER DATA ANALYSIS FOR KENYAN CITIES

The goal is to derive insights into temperature trends, rainfall patterns, and other weather variables across different regions.

Step 1

Fetch data from www.weatherapi.com for different regions in Kenya, 

Step 2

Extracting the data , So i extracted the data from 3 cities Nairobi, Kisumu and Mombasa

Step4

Creating a database and inserting the data, i created a database in SQlite called Weather_data and inserted the data inform of rows and columns

step 5 

Getting data insights
I analyzed Temparature trends, Humidity levels , Extreme Temparatures, and Rainfal(rainfall days)

Step 6

Data visualizations

I used a; Line chart to show Temparature changes over time

Bar chart to visualize the average humidity levels for each city.

Weather piechart to visualize various weather coditions recorded

A box plot to show the distribution of temperatures for each city, highlighting the median, quartiles, and potential outliers.

This project focuses on collecting weather data for different cities in Kenya (Nairobi, Mombasa, and Kisumu) from the WeatherAPI. 
The data is stored in a local SQLite database and analyzed using Python to derive insights into temperature trends, humidity levels, and weather conditions. 
These insights are useful for decision-making in weather-sensitive activities such as agriculture, tourism, and outdoor events.
